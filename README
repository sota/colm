SUPPORTED ON
============

Colm is supported on Unix-like systems.

RUN-TIME DEPENDENCIES
=====================

Colm depends on GCC at runtime. It produces a C program as output, then
compiles and links it with a runtime library. The compiled program depends on
the colm library.

BUILD DEPENDENCIES
==================

For the program:

    make libtool gcc g++ autoconf automake

For the docucumentation:

    asciidoc

BUILDING
========

Colm is built in the usual autotool way:

$ ./autogen
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Notes on RUNNING
================

To find the includes and the runtime library to pass to GCC, colm looks at
argv[0] to decide if it is running out of the source tree. If it is, then the
compile and link flags are derived from argv[0]. Otherwise, it uses the install
location (prefix) to construct the flags.

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
===================

There is a vim syntax definition file colm.vim
